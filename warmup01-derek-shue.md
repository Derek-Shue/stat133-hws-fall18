Focaccia Bread
--------------

Serves 12

### Ingredients

-   4 cups flour
-   2 teaspoons salt
-   1 teaspoon yeast
-   2 cups lukewarm water
-   4 tablespoons olive oil
-   Flaky sea salt

### Tools Needed

-   Mixing bowl
-   Whisk
-   Rubber spatula
-   Sheet pan
-   Oven
-   Refrigerator

### Recipe

1.  In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast then add water.
2.  Using a rubber spatula, mix until the water is absorbed and the ingredients form a loose, sticky dough. Cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap.
3.  Set aside in a warmish spot for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
4.  Heat oven to 425°F.
5.  Pour 3 tablespoons oil onto a rimmed sheet pan
6.  Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center.
7.  Use the forks to lift the dough onto the prepared sheet pan. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over.
8.  Let dough rest for 20 minutes.
9.  Drizzle last 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the dough and use your fingertips to stretch and press it to the edges, leaving the dough intentionally dimply.
10. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt all over and bake for 20 to 25 minutes until lightly puffed on top and golden and crisp underneath.

Quadratic Equation
------------------

*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
$$x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
 *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0

4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + 4*a**c* = 0

4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* = −4*a**c*

4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + *b*<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*

(2*a**x* + *b*)<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*

$2ax + b = \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$

$2ax = -b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$

$x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$

Comments and Reflections
------------------------

-   General use of Markdown was difficult even though we saw some limited demonstrations in lab. It will take a little while longer until I get used to the different windows, tabs, and commands. It will probably take a little while longer after that until I get used to formatting and making my assignments look nicer.
-   Latex was fairly easy to use because it seems intuitive, some of it is similar to coding language, and there was an abundance of very clear tutorials.
-   This was my first time (besides the lab) using Markdown. I think it's nice to use to make text look more organized and professional, but to me, it doesn't seem completely intuitive to use.
-   I learned how to use a lot of features of Markdown that weren't covered in the lab, such as creating tables, lists and mathematical formulas, as well as inserting images. \* I needed to search how to do the various Markdown commands. I didn't find that the built-in help functions and the official Markdown guides were very helpful. Instead, I found that the most useful resource was Youtube because I could watch someone else use Markdown to do things similar to what I wanted to do.
-   This HW took approximately 2 hours.
-   The most time-consuming part was doing the Game of Thrones code in the first part of the HW. It's hard to format tables nicely within Markdown. Though the spaces within Markdown code doesn't affect the output, it is hard to read if it's not formatted nicely. However, adding spaces to formatting the table nicely is extremely tedious. While working on it, I gave up trying to format the table, but then if I had missed adding a column somewhere, it was hard to find because my code was not formatted nicely.
